# RWRDC
Predicting Effective Drug Combinations for Cancer Treatment Using a Graph-Based Approach

## Abstract

Drug combination therapy, involving the use of two or more drugs, has been widely employed to treat complex diseases such as cancer. This approach enhances therapeutic efficacy, reduces drug resistance, and minimizes side effects. However, traditional methods to identify effective drug combinations are time-consuming, costly, and less efficient than computational methods. Therefore, developing computational approaches to predict drug combinations has become increasingly important.

In this study, we developed the Random Walk with Restart for Drug Combination (RWRDC) model to predict effective drug combinations for cancer therapy. This model calculates an efficacy score for each potential drug pair, quantifying their combined effect. We demonstrated the theoretical convergence of the algorithm and evaluated the scoring mechanism's rationality.

Cross-validation results indicate that the RWRDC model outperforms other predictive models, particularly in breast, colorectal, and lung cancer predictions across various performance metrics. A targeted case study on breast cancer further highlights RWRDC's capability to identify potential drug combinations. These findings highlight our model as a novel and effective tool for discovering effective drug combinations, offering new possibilities in cancer therapy. Additionally, the graph-based semi-supervised learning framework of RWRDC holds potential for predicting drug combinations in other complex diseases, expanding its utility in the medical field.
